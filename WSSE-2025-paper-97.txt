Authors: Harlene Luy Fook, Althea Aquilino and Micah Angela Cagas.

============================================================================================

ABSTRACT:

This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on the application of Scrum
in software development. To achieve this purpose, the authors considered articles 
published between 2019 and 2025, sourced from IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect databases.
Findings reveal that Scrum is widely used to enhance agile project management, 
enable incremental software delivery, and improve team collaboration.

* STRENGTHS:

+ The study presented three very clear and defined research questions.
+ The authors carefully examined the relevant information from each research paper.
+ The search strategy adopted by the authors was transparent, carefully describing 
the databases used as well as the keywords considered to filter the research papers.
+ Eligibility Criteria, such as inclusion and exclusion of studies and their respective 
types, are clear and well defined for the SLR.
+ Data Analysis was very well conducted and discussed for each of the three research 
questions considered.


* WEAKNESSES:

- Non-Comprehensive and Biased Search: Only two databases were considered in the study.
Research papers from the ACM Digital Library were not considered, for example.
- A large number of papers published between 1995 (emergence of the agile SCRUM method) 
and 2019 (base year of this systematic research) were not considered. For future research,
authors should include more longitudinal studies and studies from other digital libraries,
such as: DBLP Computer Science bibliography, ACM Digital Library, Web Of Science, etc.
